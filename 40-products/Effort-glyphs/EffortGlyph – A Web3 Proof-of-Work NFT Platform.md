**Documentation and Summary: 

**Overview**

EffortGlyph is a novel Web3 product designed to tokenize employee and intern work contributions into NFTs, providing a tangible and verifiable digital representation of their efforts and achievements. These NFTs serve as immutable proof-of-work records, containing metadata like logged hours, project contributions, and reference letters, securely stored on the blockchain.

  

**Core Features**

1. **Proof-of-Work NFT Generation**:

• Converts work hours, achievements, and other key metrics into NFTs.

• Embedded metadata includes:

• Total hours worked.

• Projects completed.

• Custom reference letters (hosted via IPFS or equivalent).

2. **Gasless Minting for Recipients**:

• Employees and interns receive NFTs in their wallets without incurring gas fees for the initial transfer.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:

• Uses Moralis API for seamless NFT minting and blockchain interactions.

• Built on a cost-effective Layer 2 solution (e.g., Polygon) to minimize transaction fees.

4. **Clockify Integration**:

• Automatically fetches work hours and attendance data.

• Periodic syncing with Supabase for data caching and processing.

5. **Employee/Intern Portal**:

• View work metrics, NFT metadata, and wallet status.

• Redeem NFTs directly to wallets like MetaMask.

6. **Reference Letter Integration**:

• Dynamic reference letters generated and stored on decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS).

• Links embedded into NFT metadata.

  

**Implementation Plan**

  

**1. Backend Architecture**

• **Clockify API**:

• Fetch employee work hours and attendance logs.

• Set up cron jobs or on-demand triggers for periodic syncing.

• **Supabase**:

• Cache data locally for efficient processing and retrieval.

• Store employee profiles, work metrics, and NFT metadata.

• **NFT Minting**:

• Use Moralis API to mint NFTs with embedded metadata.

• Ensure compatibility with IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage.

• **Gasless Transactions**:

• Implement meta-transactions to allow gasless NFT transfers to recipients.

• Use a relay service or wallet like Biconomy to pay for transaction fees.

  

**2. Frontend Architecture**

• **User Dashboard**:

• Built with React and TypeScript.

• Displays work metrics, NFT status, and redemption options.

• **Integration with MetaMask**:

• Employees connect their wallets to claim NFTs.

• Web3.js or ethers.js handles wallet interactions.

• **Redeem NFT Process**:

• Employees log in to the dashboard.

• Trigger NFT transfer to the connected MetaMask wallet.

• Relay service ensures a gasless first-time transfer.

  

**3. Gasless NFT Redemption Process**

1. **User Onboarding**:

• Employees/interns log in to the portal using email or organization credentials.

• Option to connect their MetaMask wallet.

2. **Initiate NFT Claim**:

• User clicks “Claim NFT” on the dashboard.

• Backend validates user data and generates the NFT if not already minted.

3. **Relay Service Execution**:

• A relay service (e.g., Biconomy) is triggered.

• The relay pays the gas fee to transfer the NFT to the user’s wallet.

4. **MetaMask Notification**:

• The NFT appears in the user’s MetaMask wallet under the “NFT” section.

  

**User Experience**

  

**For Employees/Interns**

• **Profile Dashboard**:

• View detailed work history, hours logged, and projects completed.

• Track NFT status and claim history.

• **NFT Redemption**:

• Seamless claim process with gasless transactions for the first transfer.

• **Portfolio Building**:

• NFTs double as professional achievements, showcasing contributions in a verifiable format.

  

**For Organizations**

• **Streamlined Management**:

• Automate work tracking, proof generation, and NFT minting.

• **Recognition and Transparency**:

• Showcase employee achievements in an immutable and transparent way.

  

**Technical Requirements**

1. **Backend**:

• Node.js or Python for API handling.

• Moralis SDK for blockchain interactions.

• Supabase for relational database and real-time syncing.

2. **Frontend**:

• React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI.

• ethers.js or Web3.js for wallet integration.

3. **Blockchain**:

• Polygon (or other Layer 2) for cost-effective minting.

• IPFS for decentralized metadata storage.

4. **Relay Services**:

• Biconomy for gasless transactions.

  

**Key Advantages**

1. **Gasless Entry**:

• Lower barrier for first-time Web3 users, encouraging adoption.

2. **Transparency**:

• Immutable proof of work ensures trust and verifiability.

3. **Employee Empowerment**:

• NFTs act as digital resumes and proof of contributions.

4. **Scalability**:

• Layer 2 solutions and caching enable cost-effective scaling.
