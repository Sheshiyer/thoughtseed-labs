## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
The Science waypoint embodies Thoughtseed's commitment to transforming information into knowledge through rigorous research, mind-body studies, and data-driven insights that bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern technology.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Quantum Crystal structure
- Significance: Represents the crystallization of information into structured knowledge
- Sacred geometry principles: Atomic lattice patterns reflecting quantum organization

### Position & Navigation
- Location in Fibonacci spiral: 225Â° (Secondary orbit)
- Relation to other waypoints: Connects to Engineering and Our Approach
- Activation radius: 10 units

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#FF4081` (Scientific Pink)
- Secondary: `#E91E63`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Crystalline shimmer effect
  - Active: Quantum field visualization
  - Completed: Stable crystal formation

### Animation
- Idle state: Subtle quantum fluctuations
- Hover effect: Crystal facet illumination
- Activation sequence: Crystallization wave pattern

## Content Structure
### Modal Window Content
```markdown
At Thoughtseed, we transform information into knowledge through systematic understanding and research. Our scientific approach combines:

- Rapid prototyping and development
- Mind-body interaction studies
- Quantitative and qualitative research methodologies
- Integration of biosensor data
- Natural language processing and semantic analysis
- Product testing and consumer insights

We bridge the gap between research and practical application, ensuring that scientific insights translate into meaningful solutions.
```

### User Journey Context
- Previous waypoint: Our Approach
- Next suggested waypoint: Engineering
- Alternative paths: Art (for creative interpretation) or Knowledge Base

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const scienceGeometry = new THREE.CrystalGeometry({
  faces: 8,
  radius: 4,
  detail: 2
});

const quantumEffect = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    energyLevel: { value: 0.5 }
  },
  vertexShader: quantumVertexShader,
  fragmentShader: quantumFragmentShader
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleScienceInteraction = (distance: number, energyLevel: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateQuantumEffect(energyLevel);
    revealScientificInsights();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Krebs Cycle Alignment
Represents the crucial transformation of raw information into structured knowledge, forming the foundation for engineering applications.

### Consciousness Principles
- Empirical observation of consciousness phenomena
- Integration of quantitative and qualitative methodologies
- Mind-body connection research
- Data-driven insight generation

### Sacred Geometry Connection
The crystal structure represents the perfect organization of knowledge and the underlying mathematical patterns in nature, reflecting the quantum nature of consciousness.
