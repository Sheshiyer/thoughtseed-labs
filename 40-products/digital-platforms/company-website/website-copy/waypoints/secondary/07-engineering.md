## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const engineeringGeometry = new THREE.NetworkGeometry({
  nodes: 12,
  connections: 24,
  complexity: 0.8
});

const energyFlowMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    flowSpeed: { value: 1.0 },
    energyIntensity: { value: 0.7 }
  },
  vertexShader: networkVertexShader,
  fragmentShader: networkFragmentShader
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleEngineeringInteraction = (distance: number, energyFlow: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateNetworkNodes();
    simulateEnergyFlow(energyFlow);
    revealTechnicalCapabilities();
  }
};
```
