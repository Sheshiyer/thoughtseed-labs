## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
ORIGIN represents the primordial seed of consciousness, the simplest stable structure in 3D space. Through the tetrahedron, we access the fundamental building blocks of reality and initiate the journey of transformation.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Perfect tetrahedron
- Significance: First stable geometric form
- Sacred geometry principles: Foundation of all matter

### Position & Navigation
- Location: Hidden layer, foundational point
- Activation radius: 10 units
- Discovery requirement: Complete primary navigation

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#E91E63` (Deep Rose)
- Secondary: `#C2185B`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Sacred fire pulse
  - Active: Foundational emergence
  - Completed: Eternal flame

### Animation
- Idle state: Slow tetrahedral rotation
- Hover effect: Sacred fire emanation
- Activation sequence: Geometric birth

## Interactive Element
### Cal.com Integration
```typescript
interface CalEmbed {
  embedID: "thoughtseed-consciousness-architect",
  style: {
    theme: "dark",
    brandColor: "#E91E63"
  },
  scheduling: {
    duration: 30,
    timezone: "user",
    availability: "consciousness-architect"
  }
}

// Integration Component
const OriginBooking = () => {
  return (
    <div className="origin-booking-container">
      <h3>Begin Your Journey</h3>
      <CalComEmbed {...calConfig} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Discovery Experience
- Initial reveal: Sacred geometry animation
- Background audio: Primordial OM frequency
- Ambient effect: Fire element particles

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const tetrahedronGeometry = new THREE.TetrahedronGeometry(
  radius: 2,
  detail: 1
);

const sacredFireMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    fireIntensity: { value: 0.5 }
  },
  vertexShader: sacredFireVertex,
  fragmentShader: sacredFireFragment
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleOriginInteraction = (distance: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateTetrahedron();
    revealCalendarInterface();
    playPrimordialSound();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Consciousness Principles
- First point of stability in chaos
- Foundation of material reality
- Sacred fire of transformation
- Initial spark of awareness

### Sacred Geometry Connection
The tetrahedron represents the simplest three-dimensional form, symbolizing the foundational nature of consciousness and the beginning of geometric complexity.
