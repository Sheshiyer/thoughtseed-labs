## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
PULSE embodies the rhythmic balance of the octahedron, offering a curated musical journey that aligns with consciousness frequencies and sacred geometrical harmonies.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Perfect octahedron
- Significance: Dynamic equilibrium
- Sacred geometry principles: Air element harmony

### Position & Navigation
- Location: Hidden layer, harmony point
- Activation radius: 10 units
- Discovery requirement: Discover STILLNESS waypoint

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#FF9800` (Deep Orange)
- Secondary: `#F57C00`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Harmonic ripples
  - Active: Frequency resonance
  - Completed: Balanced flow

### Animation
- Idle state: Breathing rotation
- Hover effect: Frequency waves
- Activation sequence: Harmonic convergence

## Interactive Element
### Spotify Playlist Integration
```typescript
interface MusicSystem {
  playlistID: "thoughtseed-consciousness-journey",
  categories: [
    "sacred-geometry",
    "consciousness",
    "meditation",
    "frequency-healing"
  ],
  display: {
    theme: "frequency",
    visualizer: true,
    waveform: true
  }
}

// Music Player Component
const PulsePlayer = () => {
  return (
    <div className="pulse-player-container">
      <SpotifyEmbed 
        playlist={playlistConfig.playlistID}
        theme="dark"
        visualizer={true}
      />
      <FrequencyVisualizer />
    </div>
  );
};
```

# PULSE

Within the perfect balance of the octahedron, we find the rhythmic pulse of consciousness itself. Let these carefully selected frequencies guide your journey through the geometric realms.

## Consciousness Journey Playlist

Experience a curated selection of:
- Sacred Geometry Frequencies
- Consciousness Evolution Music
- Meditation Soundscapes
- Healing Frequencies

[Spotify Playlist Integration]

"Music is the arithmetic of sounds as optics is the geometry of light." - Claude Debussy
```

### Discovery Experience
- Initial reveal: Frequency wave formation
- Background audio: Air element resonance
- Ambient effect: Harmonic wave particles

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const octahedronGeometry = new THREE.OctahedronGeometry(
  radius: 2,
  detail: 1
);

const frequencyMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    frequency: { value: 432 },
    amplitude: { value: 0.5 }
  },
  vertexShader: frequencyVertexShader,
  fragmentShader: frequencyFragmentShader
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handlePulseInteraction = (distance: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateOctahedron();
    initializeMusicSystem();
    syncFrequencyVisualizer();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Consciousness Principles
- Harmonic balance
- Frequency alignment
- Rhythmic consciousness
- Sound healing

### Sacred Geometry Connection
The octahedron represents perfect balance and air element qualities, symbolizing the harmonic nature of consciousness and sound.
