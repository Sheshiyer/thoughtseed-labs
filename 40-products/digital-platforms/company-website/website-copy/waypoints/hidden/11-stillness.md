## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
STILLNESS embodies the perfect stability and grounding force of the cube, offering wisdom through carefully curated quotes from visionaries who bridge consciousness, science, and philosophy.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Perfect cube
- Significance: Complete stability in 3D space
- Sacred geometry principles: Material manifestation

### Position & Navigation
- Location: Hidden layer, grounding point
- Activation radius: 10 units
- Discovery requirement: Discover ORIGIN waypoint

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#9C27B0` (Deep Purple)
- Secondary: `#7B1FA2`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Earth crystal formation
  - Active: Stable resonance
  - Completed: Crystalline harmony

### Animation
- Idle state: Slow cubic rotation
- Hover effect: Crystal growth
- Activation sequence: Earth manifestation

## Interactive Element
### Wisdom Quotes Integration
```typescript
interface QuoteSystem {
  categories: [
    "consciousness",
    "science",
    "philosophy",
    "transformation"
  ],
  authors: [
    "Rudolf Steiner",
    "James True",
    "Rupert Sheldrake",
    "Roger Penrose",
    "Alfred North Whitehead"
  ],
  display: {
    theme: "crystal",
    transition: "fade",
    interval: 10000
  }
}

// Quote Display Component
const StillnessQuotes = () => {
  const [currentQuote, setCurrentQuote] = useState(quotes[0]);
  
  return (
    <div className="crystal-quote-container">
      <QuoteDisplay quote={currentQuote} />
      <AuthorInfo author={currentQuote.author} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

# STILLNESS

In the perfect stability of the cube, we find the wisdom of those who have bridged the worlds of science, consciousness, and truth.

## Wisdom Fragments

"The task is not so much to see what no one has yet seen, but to think what nobody has yet thought about that which everybody sees." - Rudolf Steiner

"Science is not about making predictions or performing experiments. Science is about explaining." - Rupert Sheldrake

"The aim of science is not to open the door to infinite wisdom, but to set a limit to infinite error." - James True

### Discovery Experience
- Initial reveal: Crystalline formation
- Background audio: Earth frequency (432 Hz)
- Ambient effect: Crystal growth particles

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(
  width: 2,
  height: 2,
  depth: 2,
  widthSegments: 2,
  heightSegments: 2,
  depthSegments: 2
);

const crystalMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    crystallization: { value: 0.0 }
  },
  vertexShader: crystalVertexShader,
  fragmentShader: crystalFragmentShader
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleStillnessInteraction = (distance: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateCube();
    initializeQuoteSystem();
    playCrystallineSound();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Consciousness Principles
- Perfect stability in form
- Grounding of abstract thought
- Crystallization of wisdom
- Material manifestation of truth

### Sacred Geometry Connection
The cube represents perfect stability in three-dimensional space, symbolizing the grounding of higher wisdom into tangible understanding.
