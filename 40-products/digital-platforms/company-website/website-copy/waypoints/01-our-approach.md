## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
Our Approach represents the foundational methodology of Thoughtseed, embodying how we transform information into knowledge through a holistic, consciousness-driven approach.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Base of the Fibonacci spiral
- Significance: Starting point of transformation journey
- Sacred geometry principles: Golden ratio initiation point

### Position & Navigation
- Location in Fibonacci spiral: Origin point (0Â°)
- Relation to other waypoints: Primary anchor for navigation
- Activation radius: 10 units

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#4A90E2` (Blue)
- Secondary: `#3A80D2`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Luminous blue pulse
  - Active: Radiant expansion
  - Completed: Steady glow

### Animation
- Idle state: Gentle spiral rotation
- Hover effect: Expansion wave
- Activation sequence: Ripple effect outward

## Content Structure
### Modal Window Content
```markdown
At Thoughtseed, we believe in a holistic approach that combines scientific rigor with human-centered design. Our methodology is built on the foundation of conscious growth, systematic understanding, and practical application.

Key Aspects:
- Integration of consciousness principles
- Scientific methodology
- Human-centered design
- Systematic implementation
- Continuous evolution
```

### User Journey Context
- Previous waypoint: Entry point
- Next suggested waypoint: Services
- Alternative paths: Science or Art based on user inclination

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const approachGeometry = new THREE.SpiralGeometry({
  radius: 5,
  turns: 1.618,
  segments: 144
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleApproachInteraction = (distance: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateWaypoint();
    revealContent();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Krebs Cycle Alignment
Represents the initial transformation of information into knowledge, setting the foundation for the entire cycle.

### Consciousness Principles
- Conscious intention setting
- Mindful methodology
- Integrated awareness
- Systematic evolution

### Sacred Geometry Connection
The spiral form represents growth and evolution, starting from a central point and expanding outward following the golden ratio.
