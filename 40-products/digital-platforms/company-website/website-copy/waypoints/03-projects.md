## Waypoint Overview
### Core Concept
Projects showcases the tangible manifestations of Thoughtseed's philosophy and approach, demonstrating how we transform concepts into reality.

### Geometric Symbolism
- Form: Octagonal structure
- Significance: Balance of theory and practice
- Sacred geometry principles: Octagonal harmony

### Position & Navigation
- Location in Fibonacci spiral: 233Â° from origin
- Relation to other waypoints: Demonstrates Services in action
- Activation radius: 10 units

## Visual Design
### Color Schema
- Primary: `#F5A623` (Orange)
- Secondary: `#E59613`
- Interaction states:
  - Hover: Energy pulse
  - Active: Radiant expansion
  - Completed: Warm glow

### Animation
- Idle state: Gentle rotation with pulsing faces
- Hover effect: Faceted illumination
- Activation sequence: Expansion with energy release

## Content Structure

- Next suggested waypoint: About Us
- Alternative paths: Engineering or Design based on project interest

## Technical Implementation
### 3D Model
```typescript
const projectGeometry = new THREE.OctagonalPrismGeometry({
  radius: 4.5,
  height: 2.5,
  segments: 8
});
```

### Interaction Logic
```typescript
const handleProjectInteraction = (distance: number) => {
  if (distance <= 10) {
    activateProjectHub();
    showcaseProjects();
  }
};
```

## Philosophical Integration
### Krebs Cycle Alignment
Represents the manifestation of utility into behavior, showing how our solutions create tangible impact.

### Consciousness Principles
- Manifestation of vision
- Practical implementation
- Conscious creation
- Impact measurement

### Sacred Geometry Connection
Octagonal structure represents perfect balance between theory and practice, embodying the harmony of implementation.
